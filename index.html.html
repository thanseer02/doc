        <h2 id="html">HTML Document </h2>
        <p>The HTMLDocument is a starting point for Aspose.HTML class library. You can load the HTML page into the Document Object Model (DOM) by using 
            the HTMLDocument class and then programmatically read, modify the document tree, add and remove nodes,
             change the node properties in the document as it is described in the official specifications.HTML documents can be created from scratch as an empty document with HTML structure,
              from a string, from a memory stream or loaded from a file or a URL.
               The HTMLDocument has several overloaded constructors allowing you to create or load HTML documents.</p>
              <h3> Create an Empty HTML Document</h3>
               <p>Once the document object is created, it can be filled later with HTML elements. The following code snippet shows the usage of 
               the default HTMLDocument() constructor to create an empty HTML document and save it to a file.</p>       
    <code>
        <pre>
            using System.IO;
using Aspose.Html;
...
    // Prepare an output path for a document saving
    string documentPath = Path.Combine(OutputDir, "create-empty-document.html");    

    // Initialize an empty HTML document
    using (var document = new HTMLDocument())
    {
        // Work with the document
        
        // Save the document to a file
        document.Save(documentPath);
    }
        </pre>
    </code>
    <p>After the creation, file create-empty-document.html appears with the initial document structure: the empty document includes elements such as <html> <head> and <body>. More details about HTML files saving are in the Saving an HTML Document section.
        </p>
        <h3>Create a New HTML Document 
        </h3>
        <p>If you want to generate a document programmatically from scratch, please use constructor without parameters as specified in the following code snippet:</p>
        <code>
            <pre>using System.IO;
                using Aspose.Html;
                ...
                    // Prepare an output path for a document saving
                    string documentPath = Path.Combine(OutputDir, "create-new-document.html");
                            
                    // Initialize an empty HTML document
                    using (var document = new HTMLDocument())
                    {
                        // Create a text element and add it to the document
                        var text = document.CreateTextNode("Hello World!");
                        document.Body.AppendChild(text);
                    
                        // Save the document to a disk
                        document.Save(documentPath);
                    }</pre>
        </code>
        <h2 id="svg">SVG document</h2>
        <p>Since Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a part of W3C standards and could be embedded into the HTMLDocument, we implemented 
            the SVGDocument and all its functionality. Our implementation is based on official SVG 2 specification, so you can load, 
            read, manipulate SVG documents as it described officially.
           Since the SVGDocument and the HTMLDocument are based on the same WHATWG DOM standard, 
           all operations such as loading, reading, editing, converting and saving are similar for both documents. So, all examples where you can see manipulation with the HTMLDocument are applicable for the SVGDocument as well.
           You can create a document from a string content using SVGDocument (string, string) constructor. If you want to load the SVG Document from the in-memory System.String variable and you don’t need to save it to a file; the example below shows you how to do it:</p>
          <code>
            <pre>
                using System;
using Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg;
...
    // Initialize an SVG document from a string object
    using (var document = new SVGDocument
    {
        // Write the document content to the output stream
        Console.WriteLine(document.DocumentElement.OuterHTML);
	}
            </pre>
          </code>
        <h2 id="mhtml">MHTML Document</h2>
        <p>MHTML stands for MIME encapsulation of aggregate HTML documents. An MHTML file is an archive containing all the content of a web page
            . It stores the HTML of a web page as well as related resources on a web page, which can include CSS, JavaScript, images, and audio files.
             It is a specialized format to create web page archives, and web developers primarily use MHTML files to save the current state of a web page for archiving purposes.
              The Aspose.HTML library supports this format, but with some limitations. We only support the rendering operations from MHTML 
            to the supported output formats. For more details, please read the Converting Between Formats article.</p>

        <h2 id="ao">Asynchronous Operations</h2>
        <p>We realize that loading a document could be a resource-intensive operation since it’s 
            required loading not only the document itself but all linked resources and processing all scripts. 
            So, in the following code snippets, we show you how to use asynchronous operations and load the HTMLDocument
             without blocking the main thread:
        </p>
        <code><pre>using System;
            using Aspose.Html;
            using System.Threading;
            ...
                // Initialize an AutoResetEvent
                var resetEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);
                        
                // Create an instance of an HTML document
                var document = new HTMLDocument();
                
                // Create a string variable for OuterHTML property reading
                var outerHTML = string.Empty;
                
                // Subscribe to 'ReadyStateChange' event
                // This event will be fired during the document loading process
                document.OnReadyStateChange += (sender, @event) =>
                {
                    // Check the value of the 'ReadyState' property
                    // This property is representing the status of the document. For detail information please visit https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_doc_readystate.asp
                    if (document.ReadyState == "complete")
                    {
                        // Fill the outerHTML variable by value of loaded document                  
                        outerHTML = document.DocumentElement.OuterHTML;
                        resetEvent.Set();
                    }
                };
                
                // Navigate asynchronously at the specified Uri
                document.Navigate("https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/working-with-documents/creating-a-document/document.html");
                
                // Here the outerHTML is empty yet
                Console.WriteLine($"outerHTML = {outerHTML}");
                               
                    // Wait 5 seconds for the file to load
                    if (!resetEvent.WaitOne(5000))
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("Thread works too long, more than 5000 ms");
                    }
            
                // Here the outerHTML is filled
